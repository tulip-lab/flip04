    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets assume we are the manager of operations for a small company. We operate a few factories that make plumbus-es and ship them to many retailers. Our shipping lanes don't have uniform costs, and due to outside factors some lanes have fixed capacity. For example the route connecting the Garfield plumbus factory to the Woolmart warehouse can only handle at most 36 plumbuses per month and has an average shipping cost per plumbus of $1.69. \n",
    "\n",
    "The big boss asks:\n",
    "**What is the best way to supply our retailers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This question, as stated, cannot be confidently answered. Our coworkers in the conference room suggest some solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Supply each retailer from the factory with the lowest shipping cost\"\n",
    "* \"Supply each retailer first from the factory that has the most supply\"\n",
    "* \"Supply Woolmart first because Ted has a friend who works there\"\n",
    "* etc etc\n",
    "\n",
    "These suggestions certainly sound reasonable, but the problem is that \"best\" is loosely defined. Should we optimize for transit time, for cost, for distance? For a first model, lets solve the following problem instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What quantity of plumbus-es should we ship from each factory to each warehouse to minimize the total shipping cost?**\n",
