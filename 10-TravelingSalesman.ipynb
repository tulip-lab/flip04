    "## Traveling as a Salesman\n",
    "\n",
    "The Traveling Salesman Problem [(TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is a famous and very well studied problem in mathematics, computer science, and operations research. The problem is follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Biff Koman is a salesman tasked to visit several sites and he wants to visit them in the best order so as to minimize his total travel distance without backtracking. Biff is able to calculate the distance between any two sites but calculating the total distance of every possible route isnâ€™t possible. The number of possible routes is huge! If there are $N$ sites to visit we have $N!$ many routes, or the permutations of the sites. Biff unfortunately doesn't know python or linear programming so he resorts to a plausible greedy approach: the next site to visit should be the one closest to whichever site he is currently in. This doesn't often work though, poor Biff.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem belongs to a class of problems called [NP-Hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness) which sorta means we shouldn't expect to solve it in polynomial time without some clever approximations or heuristics. For a small number of sites, a good computer, and a strong solver, linear programming has a solution! Because TSP is a very well studied problem with tons of practical applications, for larger problems there are better solutions available and highly optimized software packages to help out. TSP also has many variants which we will explore later also."
