    "We still need to decide what M should be. In this example, M should really be the maximum amount of goods a single truck can carry. But then we would be limiting the solution to only ever using one truck per lane. Instead, we can set M to be the maximum amount a truck can carry and modify $b$!. Instead of being a binary variable to turn on and off the lane, we can make $b$ count the number of trucks we use ie 0, 1, 2, 3 etc.\n",

    "You might be wondering if we need more constraints now, since it might be possible that if we set M = 10 and we have 5 trucks, that we somehow only have qty = 7. i.e., we should only request a new truck after filling one up. The answer is yes and no. No because we are seeking to minimize costs and new trucks always increase costs, the model will never select this result. On the other hand additional inequalities often help the solver arrive at an answer quicker. This is because new constraints effectively limit the number of possibilities the solver must consider. We will explore what are called \"cutting planes\" later on when we dig deep into the branch and bound algorithm that solves most of these mixed integer problems. For now convince yourself this constraint might work:\n",

    "Another consideration might be timing. That is, if we need to ship things to some warehouses/retail outlets, a sensible constraint might be that they arrive by some specific date. I'm sure you can see how this can make the model much larger and harder. For starters maybe the cost of shipping will depend on the day, and maybe the different types of transportation might have different durations. In this type of model, the optimal allocation for today depends on what we need to do tomorrow."
